# Fastmail Ethical Evaluation

## Positives

- **No ads, no tracking.** Fastmail's business model is subscriptions, not advertising. They don't scan your email to serve ads (unlike Gmail).
- **Privacy-focused.** They've been vocal advocates for user privacy and have spoken against surveillance-based business models.
- **Open standards.** Fastmail is a major contributor to open email standards — they developed JMAP, and contribute to CalDAV, CardDAV, and IMAP standards work through the IETF.
- **Independent company.** Privately held, not beholden to a large tech conglomerate.
- **Transparency.** They publish a transparency report on government data requests.

## Potential Concerns

- **Australian jurisdiction.** Fastmail is based in Australia, which is part of the Five Eyes intelligence alliance. Australia also passed the *Assistance and Access Act* (2018), which can compel companies to provide technical assistance to law enforcement, potentially including backdoors — though Fastmail has publicly opposed this law.
- **Servers in the US.** Fastmail operates data centers in the US (as well as in Australia), meaning your data may also be subject to US legal processes.
- **No end-to-end encryption.** Fastmail does not offer E2EE for email (unlike ProtonMail or Tutanota). They encrypt data at rest and in transit, but they *can* technically read your email if compelled. They've been transparent about this tradeoff.
- **Paid only.** Not a concern ethically, but worth noting — there's no free tier, which may limit accessibility.

## Bottom Line

Fastmail is widely regarded as one of the more ethical email providers. The main concern is jurisdictional — if you need protection against state-level actors or legal compulsion, the Australian legal environment and lack of E2EE are worth weighing. For most users prioritizing privacy over convenience, they're a strong choice.
